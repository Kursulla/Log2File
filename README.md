Log2File
========

Android File loger

This is simplest Android logger you can imagine. It has single purpose and that is to put log information into file on SDCard.

When I use application while the phone is not connected to computer, you can log information to file and analyse it later.

You just add this as referenced project (this is library project) and you can use it.


You can init Log2File in different meneers by providing directory name, file name or use default values 

  Directory = "Log2File", 
  file name = "log_file.txt"
